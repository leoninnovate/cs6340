2.1. mysort fails on min_failing_test.txt because of the check on line 89 in mysort.c, y->data >= z->data. In particular, if the two data members the check is comparing are equivalent, this check is true and execution proceeds into the if statement. Within said if statement, the changed variable is reset to TRUE, and the two Link structs are swapped in the linked list. Because changed is equal to TRUE, execution continues through another iteration of the while (changed == TRUE) loop, where the same two Link structs are compared. This results in an infinite loop of swapping the two Link structs with equivalent data members. 
2.2. mysort will fail on any input list that contains duplicated integers.
2.3. To fix this bug, the if statement on line 89 should become y->data > z->data. In other words, two Link structs should only be swapped if y->data is strictly greater than z->data.
